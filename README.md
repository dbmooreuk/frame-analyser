Frame Analyser is a powerful Figma plugin specifically designed for analyzing HMI (Human Machine Interface) screen designs. It extracts detailed information about components, fonts, and colors, then creates a beautifully formatted analysis frame with visual references and organized data.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéØ **Smart Component Analysis**
- **Master Component Detection**: Identifies component sets and variants
- **Instance Counting**: Shows usage count for each component variant
- **Hierarchical Display**: Groups variants under their master components
- **Design System Focus**: Prioritizes official components over one-offs

### üé® **Advanced Color Analysis**
- **Color Extraction**: Captures all solid colors from fills and strokes
- **Style Association**: Links colors to their named color styles
- **Prioritized Display**: Shows design system colors first, custom colors last
- **Visual Swatches**: Includes color previews with hex values

### üìù **Typography Intelligence**
- **Font Detection**: Identifies all font families and styles used
- **Text Style Mapping**: Associates fonts with their named text styles
- **Design System Priority**: Highlights official text styles over custom fonts
- **Complete Coverage**: Captures all typography variations

### üñºÔ∏è **Visual Reference**
- **Frame Preview**: Includes a scaled copy of the analyzed frame
- **Smart Scaling**: Automatically fits large frames within the analysis
- **Visual Context**: Provides immediate reference for developers

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Figma Desktop App (required - web version not supported)
- Basic understanding of Figma components and styles

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/frame-analyser.git
   cd frame-analyser
   ```

2. **Install in Figma**
   - Open Figma Desktop App
   - Go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `Import plugin from manifest...`
   - Navigate to the cloned repository folder
   - Select the `manifest.json` file
   - The plugin will appear in your plugins menu as "Frame Analyzer"

3. **Verify Installation**
   - Create a test frame with some components and text
   - Select the frame
   - Run `Plugins` ‚Üí `Frame Analyzer` ‚Üí `Analyze Selected Frame`
   - An analysis frame should be created next to your original frame

## Usage

1. **Select a Frame**: Click on any frame in your Figma design that you want to analyze
2. **Run the Plugin**: 
   - Go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Frame Analyzer` ‚Üí `Analyze Selected Frame`
   - Or use the right-click context menu on a selected frame
3. **View Results**: A new analysis frame will be created next to your selected frame containing:
   - List of all components used
   - Font variations found
   - Color swatches with hex values
   - Color styles applied

## Plugin Structure

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ manifest.json     # Plugin configuration and metadata
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ code.js          # Main plugin logic and Figma API interactions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ui.html          # Plugin user interface
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md        # This documentation file
```

## Technical Details

### Figma API Usage

The plugin uses the following Figma Plugin API features:

- **Node Traversal**: Uses `findAll()` to recursively search through frame contents
- **Component Analysis**: Identifies instances and retrieves main component information
- **Typography Extraction**: Reads `fontName` properties from text nodes
- **Color Analysis**: Extracts colors from `fills` and `strokes` properties
- **Style Detection**: Identifies applied color styles via `fillStyleId`

### Analysis Process

1. **Validation**: Ensures a single frame is selected
2. **Node Discovery**: Recursively finds all child nodes within the frame
3. **Data Extraction**: Categorizes and collects:
   - Component instances and their main components
   - Font families and styles from text nodes
   - Solid colors from fills and strokes
   - Applied color styles
4. **Frame Generation**: Creates a formatted analysis frame with:
   - Hierarchical information display
   - Color swatches for visual reference
   - Proper spacing and typography

### Error Handling

- Validates frame selection before analysis
- Handles missing or inaccessible components gracefully
- Provides user feedback for common error scenarios
- Manages asynchronous operations safely

## Best Practices Implemented

- **Asynchronous Operations**: Uses `async/await` for font loading and component access
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses `Set` objects to avoid duplicate entries
- **User Experience**: Provides clear feedback and loading states
- **Code Organization**: Separates concerns between analysis, UI, and frame creation
- **Figma Guidelines**: Follows official Figma plugin development patterns

## Customization

### Styling the Analysis Frame

The analysis frame styling can be customized by modifying the `createAnalysisFrame()` function:

- **Colors**: Change background colors and text colors
- **Typography**: Modify font families and sizes (ensure fonts are loaded)
- **Layout**: Adjust spacing, padding, and positioning
- **Sections**: Add or remove information sections

### Adding New Analysis Features

To extend the plugin with additional analysis capabilities:

1. Add new data collection in the `analyzeFrame()` function
2. Create corresponding display functions (similar to `addSection()`)
3. Update the UI to reflect new features
4. Test with various frame types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **"Please select a frame"**: Ensure you've selected exactly one frame before running the plugin
- **Missing components**: Some components may not be accessible if they're from external libraries
- **Font loading errors**: Ensure fonts are available in your Figma environment
- **Performance with large frames**: Very complex frames may take longer to analyze

### Performance Considerations

- The plugin processes all nodes within a frame, so very complex frames may take time
- Font loading is asynchronous and may add processing time
- Consider breaking down very large frames for better performance

## Development

### Local Development

1. Make changes to the plugin files
2. In Figma, go to `Plugins` ‚Üí `Development` ‚Üí `Hot reload plugin`
3. Test changes immediately in your Figma file

### Debugging

- Use `console.log()` statements in `code.js` for debugging
- Check the browser console in Figma for error messages
- Use Figma's plugin development tools for advanced debugging
